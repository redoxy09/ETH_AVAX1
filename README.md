# EvenNumberArray Smart Contract

This project contains a simple Solidity smart contract that demonstrates the use of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` statements by allowing the insertion of even numbers into an array.

## Contract Overview

The `EvenNumberArray` contract allows users to:

- Add even numbers to an array.
- Ensure only even numbers are added using the `require()` statement.
- Verify the array length increment using the `assert()` statement.
- Manually trigger a revert with a custom error message using the `revert()` statement.
